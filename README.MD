# TEAM PROJECT THREE : FINAL WEB APPLICATION

## DESCRIPTION

    An application that allows user(s) to log onto their account, or go through
    the registration process that requires an email verification to sign up. 
    Afterwards, the page will load to their personal calendar display that shows
    the events transferred from the user(s)' Google Calendar. There will be a 
    clickable button in the top, left corner that will open their Google Calendar 
    in another window where they may add/remove more events.
